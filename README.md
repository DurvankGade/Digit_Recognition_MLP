<h6>MLP:</h6>Multi Layered Perceptrons is a feedforward ANN(Artificial Neural Network) consisting of fully connected neurons with a nonlinear activation function and organized in at least three layers(One input layer, one hidden layer, one output layer).

This project will use MLPClassifer from sklearn.neural_network to develop a model for recognition of hanwritten digits.
