# Digit_Recognition_MLP


**MLP**: Multi Layered Perceptrons is a feedforward ANN(Artificial Neural Network) consisting of fully connected neurons with a nonlinear activation function and organized in at least three layers(One input layer, one hidden layer, one output layer).

This project will use MLPClassifer from sklearn.neural_network to develop a model for recognition of hanwritten digits. 

**Packages and Libraries:**
1.Pandas
2.Numpy
3.Sklearn(scikit learn)
4.OpenCV
5.Pillow
