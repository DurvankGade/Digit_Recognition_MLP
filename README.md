<h3>Digit Recognition using Multi-Layered Perceptrons:</h3>
<h4>Important Instructions: </h4>
1.Please <b>download</b> the dataset from : https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14MwV3YqlnFNtzR0vEcjZlL_cnr1wpOPc  and match the filepath in the jupyter notebook. The csv files should be stored in <b>Digit_Recognition_Project/Data</b> , where Digit_Recognition_Project folder contains the <b>Project.ipynb</b> file. <br>
2.To view the output directly, use either Project.html or Project.pdf.<br>
<h6>MLP:</h6>Multi Layered Perceptrons is a feedforward ANN(Artificial Neural Network) consisting of fully connected neurons with a nonlinear activation function and organized in at least three layers(One input layer, one hidden layer, one output layer).

This project will use MLPClassifer from sklearn.neural_network to develop a model for recognition of hanwritten digits. 

<h6>Packages and Libraries:</h6>
1.Pandas<br>
2.Numpy<br>
3.Sklearn(scikit learn)<br>
4.OpenCV<br>
5.Pillow<br>
